## 🧩 Problem Statement

### 70%+ of Indian MSMEs lack Market Intelligence.

Micro and small businesses in India (over 63 million) face critical challenges:

- **Lack of Timely Insights:** Missing critical market shifts, supply issues, and policy updates.
- **Instinct-Based Decisions:** Relying on word-of-mouth rather than data, leading to missed opportunities.
- **Complex Regulations:** Difficulty tracking HSN codes and compliance updates.
- **Language Barriers:** Limited access to national and global digital information.

**MarketPulse AI** addresses these issues by providing a targeted, multilingual, and intuitive solution to bridge the information gap.
